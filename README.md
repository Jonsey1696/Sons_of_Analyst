## Outlook on Data Science Job Market:

### 1) Where are the jobs?
  By using a google api we were able to plot maps that would show us the density of the jobs posted during the 6 months the jobs were listed.  There were obvious hot spots on the West Coast but surprisingly, the majority of the jobs were located east of Texas. There is a strong cooridor of postings located in the Northeast region of the country, and good potential for jobs in most major cities on the East Coast. We were surprised to see only one job that listed as remote. It would be interesting to see how the current state of the pandemic has changed the ratio of "remote" type postings.

### 2) What skills are in highest demand?
  There were four major standouts in the skills we were able to extract from text analysis on the postings' job-description. R, Python, Machine Learning capabilities, and SQL are in the highest demand based on using a counter to measure the use of the skills. One interesting find is that for Mid and Sr. level jobs the fifth most popular skill was Spark where as for the Jr. level roles mentions of Amazon Web Services was the next runner up.

### 3) What is the expected salary?
  One confusing thought during this process is to have a better understanding of the potential salary for these positions. One of the interesting finds we made was how many different sectors of industry Data Science had permeated. from there we decided to withdraw the highest paying sectors for comparison. IT, Business Services, Biotech & Pharmacueticals, Finance, Healthcare, and finally Insurance ranked the highest in our set of postings. We were surprised that Logistics was not higher up on the list.

 If we were given more time and resources for this project we would like to be able to gather a wider range of data points.  Due to the cost of using the major job boards APIs we were unable to select a longer range of postings to be able to diaplay growth in the industry, rising and falling relevant skills, and increase in salary as adoption of this technology becomes more prevalent.
